# README local terminal setup

## Goal

Update `README.md` to be a complete, end-to-end local run guide:

- Run Codebuff from the terminal (local monorepo)
- Configure GitHub OAuth login
- Configure local OpenAI-compatible model server usage
- Add credits locally
- Publish/import agents so running in other directories works

## Constraints

- Use placeholders; never include real secrets.
- Keep instructions consistent with `bun run dev`, `bun run up`, and `bun run start-cli` scripts.
